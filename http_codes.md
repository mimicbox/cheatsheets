## 4. Client Errors
`4xx = ‚ùå`

### 400 Bad Request	
The server did not understand the request.

### 401 Unauthorized	
Client must be authorized before access, typically through some kind of login.

Request refused because content length must be specified by client.

### 412 Precondition Failed	
At least one condition of the request has failed.
